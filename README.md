# Machine Learning Journey 

### An advanced program in Machine Learning and Deep Learning

In the past year, I completed a program to learn Machine Learning, with a strong focus on Deep Learning. The program covered key AI fields like Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Deep Reinforcement Learning, all taught by renowned experts and researchers. I believe this program can provide a valuable and comprehensive understanding of these exciting fields.

While most lectures are free, I highly recommend investing in Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization, as it offers exceptional value. To solidify my knowledge and practical skills, I dedicated several months to completing projects for each chapter. These hands-on projects were crucial in developing the necessary skills for Machine Learning work. I strongly urge others to undertake similar project-based learning to enhance their understanding and proficiency in ML.
